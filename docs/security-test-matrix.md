# Security test matrix

This matrix maps security boundaries to executable regressions. `PASS` means the test is in the
default backend or E2E suite; it does not replace a production penetration test.

## Catalogue RFQ increment

- RFQ-001: current-user/current-organization list and detail isolation, foreign IDs and missing
  permissions: `backend/tests/test_quote_requests.py`
- RFQ-002: server-owned immutable snapshots; forged fields, duplicate/unknown/hidden/draft products,
  unpublished categories and invalid quantities reject the whole request: same backend test file
- RFQ-003: concurrent repeated submissions produce one request and one audit event; reused key with
  different content conflicts; failed transaction leaves no partial data: same test file, explicit
  PostgreSQL CI pass (the two concurrency cases skip on default SQLite)
- RFQ-004: login interruption, expired session, unknown network outcome, refresh/back/forward,
  account scope, storage failure and mobile/keyboard cases: `frontend/e2e/quotes.spec.js`; corrupt
  drafts and retry state also have pure unit coverage in `frontend/tests/quotes.test.mjs`
- RFQ-005: actual authenticated live catalogue → persisted RFQ → reload detail in the existing
  real-backend browser security journey: `frontend/e2e/security.spec.js`

Browser assertions run under `.github/workflows/catalog-rfq.yml` with bounded dependency, browser
installation, server readiness and test deadlines. Presence here is a coverage mapping; consult
[catalogue RFQ validation](catalog-rfq-validation.md) for which checks actually ran.
