# Node/Strapi phase-one security review

This local migration is **not production-ready**. `APP_ENV=production` remains
fail-closed. Existing Python/Vercel preview operation is not evidence of a Node
cutover. No external service, account, credential, deployment or data migration
was provisioned by this work.

## Dependency audit: 2026-10-02

The locked Strapi 5.56.0 tree is tested with Node 24.19.0 and npm 11.9.0.
The official npm registry still identifies Strapi 5.56.0 as the current stable
release. The prior 2026-10-01 snapshot had 20 affected packages (4 high,
16 moderate); a new audit of that unchanged lock reported 22 (4 high,
18 moderate). These are affected-package counts, including propagated parent
findings, not counts of independent vulnerabilities. Registry advisory metadata
can change without a dependency change.

The [current complete npm audit report](../backend-node/docs/dependency-audit.json)
records **18 affected packages: 3 high, 15 moderate, 0 critical**. The exact command
`npm audit --audit-level=high --json` still exits **1**. The independent CI audit
job is unchanged and hard-fails; neither reachability analysis nor passing
functional tests waives that gate. No advisory ignore, severity downgrade,
`--force`, Strapi downgrade, or production-readiness claim was introduced.

### Bounded update applied

The only package version changed in this pass is **Nodemailer 9.0.1 → 10.0.13**,
using a parent-scoped override under `@strapi/provider-email-sendmail` rather than
a blanket override. Earlier Axios 1.20.0, PostCSS 8.5.28, DOMPurify 3.4.16,
markdown-it 14.3.1, uuid 11.1.1 and react-router-dom 6.30.6 pins are retained.
Nodemailer and its email-provider parent no longer have an audit finding.

The latest 9.x candidate, 9.1.1, was checked but not retained: it still has newer
parser, nested-recipient and DNS-cache advisories, including parser findings
whose affected range starts at 9.1.0. A same-major number alone was not sufficient
security evidence.

The [official Nodemailer changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/master/CHANGELOG.md)
identifies Node 20+ as the 10.0.0 breaking runtime requirement, introduces dual
CommonJS/ESM builds, and records CommonJS compatibility repairs in 10.0.11.
Node 24 meets that requirement. This application uses the provider's small
`createTransport` / `sendMail` / `close` surface. Its exact installed adapter was
checked with Nodemailer 10.0.13 using an in-memory transport: CommonJS loading,
message composition, sender/reply defaults and envelope generation worked, and
file/URL attachment access remained blocked. No SMTP connection, message
delivery, real address or credential was used.

This is application-specific compatibility evidence, not an upstream Strapi
endorsement of the override. The repository maintainers own this scoped override
until a Strapi provider release adopts a patched compatible version. Recheck
its necessity and the adapter on every Strapi/provider upgrade. SMTP delivery,
MX fallback, DKIM, TLS and provider configuration require their own acceptance
before any real email integration or production use.

Verification for this dependency change:

- Clean `npm ci` completed successfully. One prior install attempt exited 137;
  a retry with a 256 MiB Node heap and two npm download sockets completed
- `npm run check` passed syntax checks and all 20 then-current unit tests
  (2026-10-02 06:33 UTC); the installed-adapter in-memory smoke also passed
- `npm ls nodemailer --all` resolves only scoped Nodemailer 10.0.13
- Full audit JSON is retained, with the high-severity gate still failing
- Broad CMS builds, server/browser tests and integration tests are performed
  separately against the final shared lock; this dependency pass does not
  substitute its small smoke test for those checks

### Remaining findings and actual entry points

All remaining packages appear in npm's production dependency classification
because Strapi ships CLI/build/development code alongside its server packages.
That classification does not prove every vulnerable code path runs in every
application mode. The high findings are **Vite**, **webpack-dev-middleware**, and
the propagated **@strapi/strapi** parent finding.

- **Vite 5.4.21 / esbuild 0.21.5:** Strapi's `dist/src/node/vite/watch.js` creates
  the Vite development server; building the CMS also uses Vite. The reported
  file-read/UNC findings concern serving development endpoints, rather than
  merely serving already-built CMS assets. The Windows-specific advisory has
  additional filesystem/platform conditions. This is a Linux local checkpoint,
  and development listeners must remain loopback-only. Vite 5 has no current
  patched release for the listed findings. Moving to the patched 6.4.3+ line
  also changes its esbuild dependency and needs Strapi build/watch acceptance.
  A separate override across esbuild's 0.x minor API boundary is not applied
- **webpack-dev-middleware 6.1.3:** loaded by Strapi's optional webpack watch
  path, not by this project's default Vite bundler. The path-traversal advisory
  depends on a `publicPath` lacking a trailing slash. Strapi's supplied webpack
  configuration adds that slash; a custom webpack configuration could change
  it. This reduces the demonstrated reachability of this specific finding,
  but is not a package fix. There is no patched 6.x release; a supported
  upstream major and webpack-watch compatibility review are still needed
- **React Router 6.30.6:** used by the native CMS browser UI, not the Next.js
  business frontend. The redirect finding depends on attacker-influenced
  navigation targets and is not dismissed. The separate SSR-hydration advisory
  is not demonstrated by the inspected CMS entry point, which uses React
  `createRoot` and `createBrowserRouter`, not server hydration. The patched
  7.18+ line is outside Strapi's declared `react-router-dom ^6.30.3` peer range
- **stream-json 1.9.1:** the inspected Strapi data-transfer adapters import
  `jsonl/Parser` and `jsonl/Stringer`; no use of the affected path-filter APIs
  was found in those adapters. This is limited source reachability evidence,
  not a guarantee about every plugin or future data-transfer configuration.
  The patched 3.5+ API/module line needs dedicated import/export compatibility
  work; the transfer surface remains subject to review

## Security invariants exercised

- CMS administrator identity is separate from business users; generic Strapi
  business-user registration and generated B2B CRUD are disabled/absent
- Generated catalog Document Service/Content Manager writes remain lifecycle-blocked.
  The native ALAGEUM CMS plugin and existing Next editor use the same versioned,
  validated and audited catalog domain service with separate identity adapters
- CMS writes lock and recheck native administrator, roles, exact unrestricted
  permission and the complete refresh-session chain. A rotated parent cannot
  survive revocation of its current child session
- CMS mutations bind the native token captured for that request and reject 401
  outside the Strapi fetch client retry interceptor. They are never silently
  replayed after login; account changes discard stale editor state
- Global catalog authority cannot be acquired from a tenant-local role
- Membership/user/organization/role status is rechecked and locked within writes
- Catalog aliases cannot shadow another public key or UUID, including hidden rows
- Version conflicts and auditing share the catalog write transaction; failed
  audit leaves no product mutation. Before/after category evidence is accurate
- RFQ owner and tenant boundaries, immutable server snapshots, body hashes and
  tenant+owner+idempotency keys are enforced in PostgreSQL transactions
- Strapi overrides the pg driver's JSONB and NUMERIC parsers. JSONB is explicitly
  decoded; RFQ quantity is selected as text to preserve Decimal(18,3) precision
- Route casing and optional trailing slashes cannot bypass the local login
  throttle or compatibility error/no-store headers
- Reviewed import is atomic and insert-only; stable UUID/public keys and existing
  administrator changes/hides are retained on repeated import

The local login limiter is process-local. Browser sessionStorage, distributed
abuse controls, upload scanning/storage, legacy identity/data import, complete
API parity, backup/restore rehearsal, hosting and cutover are unresolved
production gates. Tests do not establish production compliance or a complete B2B
business process.
