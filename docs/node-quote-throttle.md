# Catalog quote creation quota

This bounded correction starts from frozen PR22, head `8def4eb6b95588d11313f5df19f67bd80d1564a0`, tree `745d49e01f01fbb11de9174a9696ba7cd1b194d7`. The Node catalog-create route previously had no quote limiter, although the frozen Python catalog and generic create routes shared `quote_create`. This change restores the default policy on the existing Node catalog route. Generic quote creation/storage remains a separate assessed gap.

## Admission and response contract

POST `/api/v1/quotes/catalog` admits at most **10 attempts per actual socket IP in a rolling 60 seconds**, using a monotonic clock. The controller charges the attempt after native body decoding and before domain authentication, tenant resolution, input validation or idempotency lookup. Consequently decoded unauthorized, forbidden, invalid and conflicting requests consume available allowance. Both a new 201 save and a successful 200 idempotent replay consume one attempt. A rejected request returns 429 before the quote domain runs and does not add a timestamp or extend the window.

The 429 envelope is `error.code=rate_limit_exceeded`, message `Too many requests`, null details and the existing generated request ID. The response retains private/no-store and the correlated X-Request-ID header. It adds no Retry-After. Completion metrics count the request/error through the existing unlabeled API instrumentation. The limiter writes only application memory; it does not create a quote, audit, session or grant.

After the window expires, the customer can explicitly retry the same preserved key and body. Existing idempotency still decides 201 versus 200 or a conflict. A 429 is not permission to create a new submission key automatically. The inquiry UI already preserves the attempted payload, shows its Russian quota message and waits for an explicit retry; no new UI or automatic request replay is introduced.

## Identity, scope and lifetime

The key is the HTTP socket peer address, never a supplied user, tenant, key, X-Forwarded-For, Forwarded or wrapper `ctx.ip`. Existing `proxy.koa=false` is unchanged. This matches frozen Python's **default empty trusted-proxy list**. Configured legacy proxy-chain behavior and a production ingress policy are not implemented or claimed by this correction.

One limiter is constructed per application bootstrap. All callers on that peer share the quota regardless of account, organization, payload or Idempotency-Key. If a generic quote adapter is later authorized, its create controller must use this same instance; this patch adds no generic route. Reads, CMS routes and login do not consume quote allowance. The existing independent login limiter is unchanged.

The quote map holds at most 10,000 peer buckets with frozen quote-only LRU behavior: access, including a denied access, moves its bucket to the most-recent position; only the accessed bucket's expired timestamps are pruned; capacity eviction follows an accepted insertion. The unchanged login limiter has separate storage. Cross-policy capacity coupling from Python's global recorder is not claimed. The default 10/60 policy is fixed in application wiring, with no external quota override, public reset or test bypass.

The state is process-local, disappears on application recreation and is not coordinated across replicas. This is not a distributed abuse-control or production-readiness claim. Existing production-start refusal remains mandatory.

## Native parser boundary

Pinned Strapi's native koa-body/co-body parser rejects valid JSON scalars before controller dispatch. Frozen quote dependencies run before model validation, so a valid scalar must reach quota/auth before being rejected as a quote model. A narrow native `onError` hook recovers only the exact scalar-structure SyntaxError on the actual catalog POST route (case-insensitive, with at most one trailing slash). It decodes only scalars; objects and arrays always remain on the native protected parser path.

The required `strapi::body` middleware, its existing one-MiB limits, malformed-JSON rejection and prototype protection remain intact. Every other route/method and unavailable multi-trailing-slash URL rethrows the original native error. Requests rejected by those native parser protections do not reach or consume the quote quota. This correction does not broaden native media-type recognition, alter upload handling, change the wider body-size policy, or establish full legacy HTTP-parser parity.

## Verification and boundaries

The frozen reference generator executes only unchanged Python limiter/client-key/exception class/function ASTs with source hashes and standard-library dependencies. Its 12 quote-only scenarios cover 288 attempts plus nine peer-key vectors: exact cutoff, sliding windows, denied attempts, isolation and strict LRU eviction. This is algorithm evidence, not execution of the complete legacy application or endpoint.

Focused Node checks also cover controller ordering, no domain work after denial, unchanged read routing, scalar recovery scope and native failure propagation. A dedicated fresh Strapi/PostgreSQL harness uses real loopback source sockets, the unchanged default quota and an actual 60-second wait. Required live cases include decoded auth/schema failures, malformed/protected bodies, two peer buckets, concurrent admission, forwarding spoof resistance, exact error headers/metrics, atomic no-write denials and explicit idempotent recovery. Its application, cluster and private-fixture cleanup results are independently required.

The real browser case runs after the existing four Node RFQ cases against the same hosted backend/frontend. It discovers remaining allowance without assuming a starting count, verifies login and the preserved inquiry after a real 429, checks desktop/mobile layout, waits for the real window, and explicitly retries the same key/body once. Acceptance requires one saved quote, a 200 replay and one new own-list entry. It has no route interception, fake clock, quota reset, skipped project or retry. Token-bearing traces are disabled; deliberate fictitious-state PNGs and sanitized result JSON are retained.

Local checkpoint on 2026-10-03: **538 backend checks, 102 existing PostgreSQL integration tests, 339 frontend units and frontend lint passed**. The dedicated real runtime passed **11/11 groups**, with 74 HTTP requests/unique generated IDs, 55 counted errors, 14 quote creations/14 audits, and 60,051 ms actual elapsed before expiry retry. Full protected rows/schema/grants/indexes matched, and all three cleanup results passed. Frozen reference regeneration, the exact CI report assertions, workflow parsing and one-case browser discovery also passed.

An initial runtime fingerprint mismatch was traced to pinned Strapi upload's native `plugin_upload_metrics` bookkeeping, scheduled 15 seconds after fresh startup. The harness now waits boundedly for that observable initialization before its baseline. It excludes no additional table/key, normalizes no protected data and changes no native job or limiter. The corrected live run passed. Independent read-only review also closed the parser route-scope and browser-trace findings. Actual hosted browser execution and current-head build/security reports remain pending at this local checkpoint; the PR will record their terminal outcome.

The [route inventory](node-legacy-route-inventory.json) remains 35 Node declarations, 33 overlaps and 17 absent legacy business routes. No schema, generic quote parser/storage, role grant, login policy, dependency lockfile, security-audit waiver, merge or deployment is part of this correction.
